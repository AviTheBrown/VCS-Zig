# 🦎 ZigVCS: A Minimal Version Control System

Hey there, fellow code wranglers! Welcome to ZigVCS, a super minimal version control system written in Zig. Because why not, right?

## 🚀 What's This All About?

ZigVCS is my little experiment in building a bare-bones version control system using the awesome Zig programming language. It's not trying to replace Git or anything fancy like that. Think of it more as a "Git's little cousin who's still figuring things out."

## ✨ Features

- **Basic Version Tracking**: Keep tabs on your file changes without breaking a sweat.
- **Lightweight**: No bloat here! Just the essentials.
- **Written in Zig**: Because sometimes you want to zig when others zag.

## 🤔 Why Though?

Good question! This project exists because:
- I wanted to learn more about how VCS systems work under the hood.
- Zig is cool, and I wanted to build something with it.
- Sometimes you just need to create things for the heck of it.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This is very much a work in progress. Expect bugs, missing features, and general "what was I thinking?" moments. Pull requests, issues, and "why would you do this?" comments are all welcome!

Happy version controlling, you magnificent code wizards! 🧙‍♂️✨
